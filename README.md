# Mutation interpreter
The mutation interpreter is a extension on the
[mutation observer](https://github.com/qianqianzhu/mutation_observer).
The scripts in this repository assume the use of this prototype project.
Furthermore, a license of JHawkStarter is required to generate additional
metrics required by the mutation observer. A license for JHawkStarter can
be obtained from [http://www.virtualmachinery.com/](http://www.virtualmachinery.com/).
JHawkStarter is assumed to be placed inside this repository in a folder called
`JHawkStarter/`.
This repository is meant as a prototype and should not be assumed to be stable
for daily use.

## Setup `main.py`
Main.py is used to check each anti-pattern rule for violations in projects.
The anti-pattern rules are generated read from the CSV file created with
the [mutation observer](https://github.com/qianqianzhu/mutation_observer).
The file is assumed to be located in `JHawkStarter/Output/`. All output generated
with JHawkStarter should be situated in this folder. The naming of the CSV
generated by the mutation observer is assumed to be `[project_name]_all_results.csv`.

For analyzing a specific project, the `PROJECTS` variable can be adapted at the
top of the file. Each key in the Dict set to `True` is assumed to be analyzed.
To only show the violations for which mutants have survived, the `SURVIVING_ONLY`
variable can be set to `True`. To focus on only one rule, the `FOCUS_RULE` variable
can be used. To disable any focus, set the variable to any arbitrary negative
number.
